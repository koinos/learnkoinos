# Launching a token collection

This guide allows users to manually launch a new Token based on current KCS-1 (Koinos Contract Standard) for Tokens.

The repo requires `koinos-sdk-as-cli` to compile and build.

The basic usage of this repo is as follows:

1. Clone and install the repo
2. Modify the contents of collections.ts to fit your token project
3. Compile and gather the `.wasm` and  `.abi` files.
4. Manually deploy to the Koinos main net.

## Initial setup

#### Prerequisite

You must have already setup your developer environment and installed the `koinos-sdk-as-cli` from [Module 4](../M4/1_introduction.md). If you haven't done so, please review that lesson and setup the SDK.

#### Clone the repo

Clone the repo by using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/roaminro/koinos-sdk-as-examples/tree/main/token
```

Enter the project folder by using the following command:

```
cd koinos-sdk-as-examples
```

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
yarn install
```

## Customize 

Customize the specifics of the token project by first modifying `token/assembly/Token.ts`. 

Define the following:
`_name:` The Name of your Token
`_symbol`: The Symbol for your Token
`_decimals`: The decimal places for your token.

```
- _name: string = "Token";
- _symbol: string = "TKN";
- _decimals: u32 = 8;
```
Once you've made all your changes, update the token name in the unit test file located in `token/assembly/__tests__/token.spec.ts.` Search for the term `Token` and replace with your token name. Similarly, search for the term `TKN` and replace it with your token symbol.

Next, build and debug your project with the following command from the `assembly/token` directory.

```
yarn build:debug
```

Run unit test by using the following command:

```
yarn test
```

## Compile the contract

Once all your modifications have been made, you're now ready to build the release version. To do this, use the following command from the `assembly/token` directory.

```
yarn build:release
```

Once the build completes, you will need to locate your `.wasm` and `.abi` file to upload to the blockchain.

Your `.wasm` file is located in the following directory:

```
/koinos-sdk-as-examples/token/assembly/build/release/contract.wasm
```

Your `.abi` file is located in the following directory:

```
/koinos-sdk-as-examples/token/assembly/build/release/token.abi
```

With these two files, generate a koinos wallet with `koinos CLI` and deploy as shown in [Module 4: Uploading your Smart Contract](../M4/7_upload-contract.md).

## Mint tokens

#### Using Koinos CLI

Register your new token address with `koinos-cli` as shown in [Module 1](../M1/1_introduction) and run the `mint` method.

#### Using Koinos Blocks

Head over to [KoinosBlocks](http://koinosblocks.com) and enter the address that you uploaded your token smart contract to in the search bar.

Connect to Koinos Blocks with Kondor wallet that contains your token contract using the `Connect Wallet ` button:

Then scroll down to the `writeable options` as fill in the specified data:

`TO ADDRESS:` Is the address that the tokens are being minted and sent to. Tokens cannot be minted and sent to its own wallet address!

`VALUE unit64:` Input the number of tokens to mint in this transaction. If you previously specified the `MAX_SUPPLY` to be 10, then the maximum number you can enter here is 10 or however many more tokens can be mitned until you reached 10.

Remember our previous discussion about rclimits from Module 2.

Sign and send, and you can play around with the `Read only methods` to check the total supply and more. To see your collection appear on the testnet version of Kollections, visit www.kollection-staging.app
